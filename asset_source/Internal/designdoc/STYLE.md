## Watch Your Language

Don't use big words if you can avoid it.

Cuss sparingly. This gives swears more impact when needed. There is no reason to be overly fowl. Don't get cut on your edge.

Don't be dry. Be over the top as often as possible. Slip educational content in when possible.

## The University that exists in Bowling Green

Do not refer to the real life University in Bowling Green Ohio. We asked University Marketing and Communications and it's better this way. 

The university portrayed in the Game is totally different. Department names should be different enough to be deniable.

### University Departments, Offices, Groups that have given permission to feature them.

* Anime In Northwest Ohio (We made this game, so of course)

### Individuals and Groups that have given permission to feature them.

* Dirk Manning

* GeePM

* Matt Visual

* Brava (Paul Dilyard)

* The Wood County Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services Board.

## Referring to Anime and Manga series.

Don't refer to real Anime and Manga series. Instead, make up a fake one or refer to a genre broadly.

IE: Welchert In The Crib: Z, Magical Girl anime

## Coding Style

This is a visual novel. If I can understand your code when I'm sleep deprived or inebriated it's right.
