Note: Take a photo with good composition. You can't just filter out a poor composition.

Note: Real Artist ($$$$$) > Deep Learning ($$$) > Resynthesis (Time) > Selective Blur (Will have to do) > Filters (Overused and a turn off.)

Note: Try to get rid of flare, speckles, etc.

1. Selective Gaussian Blur that until it's flat.
