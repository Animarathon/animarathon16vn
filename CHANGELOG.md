# The Animarathon Version Number System.

Version Numbers are completely arbitrary.

# Pre-Release Versions

0.0 Conceptual Planning
Late December 2016
* Thinking about the game mostly.

0.1 Longitude Highway
Original version. Featured Orion driving into Bowling Green from the south.
* Framework for a game about drifting cars at anime conventions.
* Start of original XVVN git repo

0.2 4 Ohio
Added significant new content, including artists alley (Based on the Ballroom).
* Introduced a photo to washed out blur background transition.
* Most item graphics added.
* A shift to a serious tone and story.

0.3 Frogs?
Realized that incorporating the subject matter I had planned into a game about an anime convention would seriously backfire.
* Shift back to fun tone.

The ANO president informed me that Orion was actually male.
For a while I tried to just keep things the way they were, but the group disapproved during playtesting.
To reduce typos, I just made Ann the main character and swapped the variables.
* Added Frog Sensei & Lake Erie plot.

0.4 Wooster Bruiser
Around March 10th
The fruit of my Spring Break.
A version that was more or less "Feature Complete", but lacked a way to progress in game.
* Most characters drawn and animated.
* While complete-ish, very bare bones.
* Not possible to complete without commands

# Open Beta Versions.

0.5 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (I'm late!)
March 25th,2017 (Start of actual versioning with dates.)
The AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA commits from an hour before Animarathon XV.
I figured the game was half complete so I called it 0.5.
Released at Animarathon XV, then retracted later that day after critical bugs were discovered.
* The first version to receive media attention.
* First version to use Neural Style artwork. 
* Generated the Sunday before, March 19th, in the Mac Hall AI Lab.
* The Mac Hall AI lab is my cousin's dorm room lmao.
